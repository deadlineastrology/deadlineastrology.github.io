🌌 **COSMIC FORECAST: Monday, June 2, 2025**  
The mind crackles. Gemini Sun, Mercury, and Jupiter flood the sky with ideas, yet clarity is not promised. Mental overload disguises itself as curiosity. Distractions multiply like static.

The Moon in early Virgo tries to organize the chaos—but perfection isn’t the answer, devotion is. Mars in Leo clashes with the urge to control. Venus and Chiron in late Aries mark the final wound: the fear of not being chosen. Saturn and Neptune in Aries demand new spiritual architecture—foundations made not of dreams, but of fire.

Pluto retrograde in early Aquarius continues to unearth collective fractures. We are not who we once were. The future won’t wait.

Venus shifts into Taurus on June 6. Mars enters Virgo on June 17. Chiron retrograde looms July 30.  
**Healings must happen now—before the window seals shut.**

> 🕒 **Deadline:** Venus exits Aries on June 6. Don’t ignore what aches.

### ♈︎ Aries  
Old wounds resurface when you feel unseen. With Venus and Chiron both in your sign, you're seduced by independence—but longing for soft touch. The Virgo Moon demands you show up for yourself first, even if no one claps. Saturn in your sign begins its test: what do you believe in when no one's watching?  
**Window:** Claim your worth before Venus leaves Aries on June 6.  
**Affirmation:** *I am not too much for the right ones.*

---

### ♉︎ Taurus  
There’s a hum beneath the noise—intuition whispering truths logic denies. With Gemini planets crowding your 2nd house, your values are being rewritten. The Virgo Moon stirs your desire for romance, art, and creative control, but Mars in Leo agitates your home life.  
**Deadline:** Use the fire before it burns the bridge.  
**Power Word:** *Alignment.*

---

### ♊︎ Gemini  
You're magnetic. Irresistible. And secretly unraveling. The spotlight (Sun, Mercury, Jupiter) feels both euphoric and exhausting. You can’t split yourself into a thousand faces just to keep everyone engaged. Virgo Moon reminds you: the body is the compass.  
**Window:** Before Mercury enters Cancer on June 8, say what haunts you.  
**Call to Action:** *Say it before you swallow it again.*

---

### ♋︎ Cancer  
You’re seeing what you’ve buried. Dreams, fears, buried rage. Gemini's grip on your 12th house creates mental fog, but it’s laced with divine clues. The Virgo Moon clears a corner of the mind. A message, a memory, a mistake—don’t run.  
**Deadline:** Jupiter exits Gemini on June 9. Accept the lesson now.  
**Power Word:** *Reveal.*

---

### ♌︎ Leo  
Mars lights a fire in your name—but are you chasing passion or escaping consequence? You want to be seen, admired, validated. But with Pluto retrograde in your 7th, someone else’s reflection might be distorting your view. The Virgo Moon calls for practicality. What do you actually need?  
**Window:** Ground before Mars leaves your sign on June 17.  
**Affirmation:** *I deserve mirrors that reflect my truth, not just my glow.*

---

### ♍︎ Virgo  
The Moon in your sign sharpens your focus—but too much precision kills the pulse. Let the mess in. Gemini’s swarm of energy in your 10th house means the spotlight is flickering. You can’t control what others see, only how deeply you root into what’s real.  
**Deadline:** Set your boundaries before Venus enters Taurus on June 6.  
**Call to Action:** *Let the world feel your edge.*

---

### ♎︎ Libra  
Something sacred is cracking open. A spiritual confrontation is underway—Saturn and Neptune in your 6th whisper that healing is not linear. The Gemini stack in your 9th house floods you with visions, options, doubts. This is more than wanderlust—it’s a calling.  
**Window:** Clarity crystallizes by the Cancer ingress on June 21.  
**Power Word:** *Devotion.*

---

### ♏︎ Scorpio  
Secrets aren’t just hidden from others—they’re hidden from you. Pluto retrograde in your 4th is rewriting your roots. The Virgo Moon highlights your place in the collective: are you the alchemist or the ghost? Venus and Chiron in your 6th house crack open work-related wounds.  
**Deadline:** Express what you fear before Venus exits Aries on June 6.  
**Affirmation:** *I don’t have to earn tenderness.*

---

### ♐︎ Sagittarius  
It’s not about winning. It’s about listening. Venus and Chiron highlight fractures in your relationships. You long for adventure, but the Gemini stellium in your 7th forces you to read between the lines of what someone’s not saying. The Virgo Moon exposes reputational pressure.  
**Window:** Before Mars enters Virgo on June 17, decide what you're fighting for.  
**Call to Action:** *Make peace without folding.*

---

### ♑︎ Capricorn  
You are transforming behind closed doors. Your systems are outdated. The Virgo Moon gifts a glimpse of what’s next, but the path forward is not straight. Gemini energy overwhelms your routines; Saturn in Aries challenges your inner authority. What are you loyal to that’s no longer alive?  
**Deadline:** Release the ghost before Jupiter enters Cancer on June 9.  
**Power Word:** *Shed.*

---

### ♒︎ Aquarius  
You’ve outgrown your shell—but fear who you’ll become outside of it. Pluto retrograde in your sign drags you into the underworld, while Gemini’s planetary choir calls you to create, flirt, risk. The Virgo Moon reminds you: transformation is messy. Let it be.  
**Window:** Before Mercury enters Cancer on June 8, confess what you're afraid to hope for.  
**Affirmation:** *I am allowed to want more.*

---

### ♓︎ Pisces  
The Virgo Moon stares at you like a mirror—pointing to imbalance, avoidance, projection. Saturn and Neptune in your sign are remapping your identity; it’s disorienting and divine. Relationships are asking more of you now. Don’t slip into sacrifice. Step into sacred reciprocity.  
**Deadline:** Claim your needs before Chiron retrogrades on July 30.  
**Call to Action:** *Name your boundaries. Then hold them like prayer.*
